            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have a degree in law and worked as a lawyer in Brazil, but I felt that it wasn't what I wanted for myself. So, I began to ponder what would make me happy and fulfilled professionally. Consequently, I decided to pursue a second degree in an area that always seemed very interesting to me. I am a very curious person who loves challenges. Learning is what makes me feel alive. I also feel that I am discovering who I am and what I want to do as a professional. I know that I work hard on the things I set out to do and always give my best</p>
