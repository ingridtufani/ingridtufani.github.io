                    <div class="job">
                        <p>
                            I have a degree in law and worked as a lawyer in Brazil, 
                            but I felt that it wasn't what I wanted for myself. 
                            So, I began to ponder what would make me happy and fulfilled professionally. 
                            Consequently, I decided to pursue a second degree in an area that always seemed very interesting to me. 
                            I am a very curious person who loves challenges. Learning is what makes me feel alive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also feel that I am discovering who I am and what I want to do as a professional. 
                            I know that I work hard on the things I set out to do and always give my best

                        <h3>Developing Skills</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Programming Logic: I need to understand the fundamental principles of programming logic 
                                to grasp how programs work and how to effectively solve problems.
                            </li>
                            <li> Analytical Thinking: I must be able to analyze complex problems and break them down 
                                into smaller steps to solve programming problems effectively.
                            </li>
                            <li>Persistence and Patience: Learning programming can be challenging, 
                                so I need to have persistence to overcome obstacles and patience to solve complex problems.
                            </li>
                            <li>Problem-Solving Skills: It's crucial for me to identify and solve problems 
                                in my own code effectively.
                            </li>
                            <li>Adaptability: Since technology is always changing, I need to be willing 
                                to learn constantly and adapt to new tools and technologies.
                            </li>
